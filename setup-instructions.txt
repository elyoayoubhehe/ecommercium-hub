ECOMMERCIUM HUB - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

Prerequisites:
-------------
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. Make sure ports 3001 and 8080 are free

Setup Steps:
-----------

1. First, install Python dependencies:
   cd backend
   pip install flask==3.0.0
   pip install flask-cors==4.0.0
   pip install requests==2.31.0
   pip install beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
   pip install fake-useragent==1.4.0

   -- OR use this single command --
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   cd ..
   npm install
   npm install concurrently

3. Run the application:
   npm run dev

This will start:
- Backend server on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend on http://localhost:8080

Notes:
------
- The application will automatically open in your browser
- The Amazon scraper might take a few seconds to fetch results
- If you get any port conflicts, make sure nothing else is running on ports 3001 and 8080

Troubleshooting:
---------------
If you get any errors:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Try running the servers separately:
   - Backend: cd backend && python app.py
   - Frontend: npm run dev

To stop the application:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal
- If running separately, you'll need to stop both servers
